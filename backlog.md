# //TODO come up with a cool name

## Rendering the game 
1. Start the application, click "New Game" button and the game field will launch and the game will start.
2. If we have time, we can add different difficulties, difficulty menu will appear after pressing "New Game".

## Movement of the opponents
1. After the game launches, opponents try to catch the player and end the game, using a pathfinding algotithm.
2. If we have time, we can also implement this: as the runtime advances, the bots should become faster and be able to catch up to the player with more ease.

## Movement of the player
1. After the game launches, the player is able to move in directions (NSWE) inside the game field using some key input (to be decided later).
2. no remark yet

## Generating the fuel canisters
1. After the game launches, there should be constantly generated fuel canisters in the game field in random tiles, which upon collection by the player extend the player's life length.
2. Fuel canisters should generate constantly, but there is a max cap of them in one moment.

## Player lifetime counter
1. After the game launches, a Player lifetime counter should appear somewhere in the game field (without obstructing the field). It should be set to a default value (TBD).
