# Documentation for Pseudo-random generation

## Sources
1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehmer_random_number_generator

## Explanation
1. We use constants established in the Lehemr random number generator to generate a reproducable sequence of random numbers, based on an Integer-based seed.

2. We took the constanst described in the algorithm and reproduced its functionality for the programs purposes.ss
